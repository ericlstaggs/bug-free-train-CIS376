Defligration arrestors

User Story

For the Big Idea explain what defligration is,
 who my team is and a little bit about them,
  what we are working on for the BigIdea.

I want to educate about the  dangers, show what is available, what our company plans to do

So that I help prevent these explosions, save lives, reduce cost in gas extraction


Concept of page


CIS 376 Front-End Web App Rubric (100 points)

1) GitHub Repository Setup & Hygiene (20 pts)

A. Repo naming + structure (8)

(2) Repo name in lower-kebab-case
(2) index.html in project root
(2) Logical folders present (as used): assets/, scripts/, styles/, pages/, docs/
(2) Clean, consistent file naming (lower-kebab-case; no weird caps/spaces)
B. No extra / unused artifacts (6)

(3) No extraneous files (zips, duplicates, random screenshots in root, old versions)
(3) Dead/unused code removed or clearly disabled (not “leftovers everywhere”)
C. Repo details & access (6)

(2) Repo “About” includes purpose + GitHub Pages link
(2) Deployed URL works (no 404) and matches repo
(2) Basic accessibility/validity checks noted OR obvious best practices (alt text, labels, readable contrast)
 

2) README / Docs Quality (20 pts)

You said: README is the “first grading stop.” This section is intentionally detailed.

A. Required README sections present (10)

(2) Title (H1) + short descriptor
(2) Authorship & attribution (resources, inspirations, libraries, assets)
(2) A one-liner quote about the app (tagline)
(2) A clear user story
(2) Link(s) to repo + deployed app + verification note (“tested on mobile + desktop”, etc.)
B. Modeling / inspiration evidence (4)

(4) Screenshot/screengrab of the page/content they modeled/fixed/inspired by
must live in an Issue or Wiki (or docs) and be linked from README
C. Code block + explanation (6)

(3) A syntax-highlighted code block included (HTML/CSS/JS)
(3) Explanation connects DOM → script → DOM/data (what triggers, what changes, what data flows)
 

3) Deployed App: Purpose, UX, Flow, Features (35 pts)

A. Purpose + core flow (8)

(3) App purpose is immediately clear to the user
(3) Primary flow is coherent (where to start, what to click/type, what happens)
(2) User input produces meaningful output (not just a placeholder)
B. Mobile-first layout & visual design (9)

(4) Mobile responsive (usable on phone widths; layout doesn’t break)
(3) Modern layout conventions (spacing, hierarchy, nav, cards/tables, etc.)
(2) Consistent styling (Bootstrap-first, typography, readable UI)
C. Feature requirements (18)

(6) Login / logout flow exists and works (even “simple front-end auth”)
(4) Search works against displayed content/data
(4) Sort and/or filter works (baseline requirement; bonus points handled later too)
(2) Includes internal & external links appropriately
(2) Includes a page/area to view temporary/session data (and user can reach it)
 

4) Source Code: Implementation & Quality (20 pts)

A. HTML quality (6)

(2) Clean semantic structure (headers/main/sections; meaningful ids/classes)
(2) Mobile-first structure supports responsive layout
(2) No inline CSS/JS (external files), unused markup removed
B. CSS + Bootstrap usage (6)

(3) Bootstrap-first styling used effectively (layout/grid/components)
(1) Imported font/icons used appropriately
(2) Cohesive design extras (e.g., svg background pattern) without breaking readability
C. JavaScript requirements (8)

(1) Password check implemented in front-end logic
(1) Password result clearly logged in console (success/failure feedback)
(1) Meaningful console logging used for debugging (e.g., state changes, user input, session status)
(2) DOM ready / initialization pattern (DOMContentLoaded or equivalent)
(1) Event listeners + named functions (not everything inline)
(1) DOM mutation updates UI based on state/data
(1) Session storage usage
(1) Ability to clear/reset session data
5) GitHub Profile (5 pts)

(3) GitHub profile includes link to repo and deployed app
(2) Profile looks “refactored/clean” (pinned repo or clear project section)
 

Bonus (optional, up to +15 pts)

Use this if you want students to be rewarded for stretch features without punishing baseline completion.

(+5) Data is loaded from internal JSON (fetching local JSON) with 5+ meaningful items
(+5) Filter feature beyond basic search (category filters, tags, toggles, etc.)
(+5) Sort feature beyond basic filter (A–Z, by date, by type, grid/list toggle, etc.)
(You can cap bonus so total doesn’t exceed your course policy—e.g., “max grade 100” or “bonus can push to 105”.)

 

Clean README “Checklist”

README must include (in this order):

# App Title
1.Authorship & Attribution (who made it + what you used)
2.One-liner quote/tagline
3.User Story (As a…, I want…, so that…)
4.Links: Repo + GitHub Pages + Wiki/Issue design evidence 
5.Design: pic(s) with short description of another site that inspired your design
6.Model/Inspiration evidence: screenshot link + 1–2 sentences (“what I copied/fixed/improved”)
7.Code Block + Explanation: show 8–25 lines + explain DOM → script → DOM/data
8.Architecture / Infrastructure Note: tools/libraries used; “front end app fetching internal data”
9.Verification: tested in mobile + desktop, any known issues
